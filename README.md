# 🖼️ AttnGAN: Text-to-Image Generation Using GANs  

🚀 A deep learning project that generates images from text descriptions using **AttnGAN (Attention Generative Adversarial Network)**.  
Trained from scratch on the **MS-COCO dataset**, this model learns to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions.  

## 🔹 Features  
✅ Implements **AttnGAN** for text-to-image synthesis  
✅ Trained on **MS-COCO dataset** for diverse image generation  
✅ **Locally deployable** for testing & evaluation  
✅ **Web application** with an interactive UI (Coming Soon!)  

## 📂 Project Structure  
```
📁 dataset/       - MS-COCO dataset & preprocessing scripts  
📁 model/         - AttnGAN model architecture & training code  
📁 training/      - Scripts for training the GAN from scratch  
📁 deployment/    - Local testing setup  
📁 web_app/       - Web-based UI for text-to-image generation  
```

## ⚡ Future Work  
- Improve image quality using **fine-tuning & hyperparameter tuning**  
- Deploy as a **web app** for real-time text-to-image generation
